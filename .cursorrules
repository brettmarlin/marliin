# Marliin.com - Cursor Rules

## Project Context
This is the marketing site for Marliin, Brett Marlin's design-led AI consultancy. 
Single-page React site deploying to Cloudflare Pages.

## Design Decisions (All Locked)
- Every design decision in App.jsx is intentional. Do not change layout, spacing, typography, or color without explicit instruction.
- Brand color (cognac): #B8652A — the ONLY accent color
- Background: #FAF7F2 (cream), Dark sections: #1A1714 (charcoal)
- Heading font: Cormorant Garamond. Body font: DM Sans.
- Body text uses font-weight 300 for airiness.
- No em-dashes in any copy. Use commas or periods.
- No emojis anywhere on the site.
- Animations use IntersectionObserver with translateY(36px) reveal, 0.9s cubic-bezier(.16,1,.3,1)

## Architecture
- Single component in App.jsx (intentionally monolithic for simplicity)
- All images in /public/images/ referenced by path
- No CSS framework — all custom styles
- No backend, no CMS, no forms
- External links: Google Calendar booking, MAF Machine subdomain, LinkedIn, Substack

## When Making Changes
- Preserve all scroll-linked animations
- Preserve the photo strip infinite scroll behavior
- Preserve mobile responsive breakpoints (768px)
- Test both light (#FAF7F2) and dark (#1A1714) sections for contrast
- The Logo SVG component renders the double-i brand mark — do not modify
